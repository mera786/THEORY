(1) Core Concepts (DI, IoC, Beans, MVC) :
------------------------------------------
Q1. What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring Boot?
-> Dependency Injection is a design pattern used by Spring Boot to automatically create and manage objects (dependencies) your classes need — without you manually creating them.
-> Dependency Injection is a technique where objects (dependencies) are injected into a class by the framework (Spring) at runtime
Anology:
 - Imagine you're building a house. You don’t make the bricks yourself — you ask someone to provide them. Similarly, Spring Boot provides the objects your app needs.

Q2. Why Use DI?
 - Loose coupling between components
 - Automatic lifecycle management (Spring manages the objects)

Q3. What is Spring IoC?
-> Spring IOC Container is the core of the Spring Framework where the logical implementation of dependency injection done.
-> It manages the lifecycle and Creation of application objects (called beans).
-> It creates, configures, and wires objects automatically based on configuration
-> Helps implement Dependency Injection (DI) easily.
-> Promotes loose coupling because your classes don’t instantiate their dependencies directly.
- There are two main types of IoC containers provided by Spring:
         - BeanFactory
         - ApplicationContext

Q4. Difference Between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext ?
BEANFACTORY :
-------------
A basic IoC container that is part of the core module in Spring,
It provides fundamental support for dependency injection and bean lifecycle management.
Features:
•	Lazy Initialization: Beans are created only when they are requested.
•	Lightweight: It is simple and has minimal overhead.
•	Use Case: Suitable for applications with limited resources or where advanced features like event handling are not required.
•	Interface: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory.
ApplicationContext:
-------------------
A more advanced IoC container built on top of the BeanFactory. It includes all BeanFactory features plus additional enterprise-level functionalities.
Features:
•	Eager Initialization: Beans are created during container startup by default (except for @Lazy annotated beans)
•	Advanced Features: Supports internationalization, event propagation, declarative mechanisms, and AOP.
•	Multiple Implementations:
                      ->  ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: Loads configuration from an XML file in the classpath.
                      -> FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: Loads configuration from an XML file in the file system.
                      -> AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: Loads configuration from Java-based annotations.
•	Use Case: Preferred for most applications because of its rich feature set
•	Interface: org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext.

 Q5. Explain Bean life cycle?
Bean is Created---->Dependencies Injected (@Autowired)----->Execution(Bean is use by the application)------>Destruction of the bean

Q6. What is Spring MVC?
-> Spring MVC stands for Spring Model-View-Controller.
—> It's a web framework in the Spring used to build web applications using the MVC design pattern.
-> How Spring MVC Works:
         a. User sends a request (/home) or from html form.
         b. DispatcherServlet (front controller) catches the request.
         c. Finds the matching controller method using annotations like @GetMapping.
         d. Executes logic and prepares data (Model).
         e. Returns a view.

Q7. Explain technical flow of Spring Boot project?
Postman->controller(DTO CLASS)->service->Repository->database and vice versa

Q8. How will you use external library in Spring Boot project?
Adding external dependency in pom.xml file and then do further coding.

Q9. How many ways to do dependency injection?
There are many ways like,
•	Field based
•	Constructor based
•	Setter based

Q10. Explain difference between constructor injection vs setter injection?
CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION:
   - It promotes immutablity
   - Dependencies injected through the constructor are considered mandatory, meaning the object cannot be fully functional without them.
   - An object created with constructor injection is always in a valid state because all required dependencies are provided at the time of creation.
   - Considered more testable and predictable because the dependencies are clearly defined and always provided at object creation
SETTER INJECTION:
   - Dependencies injected through setters can be optional, allowing you to set them later or not at all depending on the situation.
   - An object created with setter injection might be in an invalid state initially if not all necessary dependencies are set using setters
   - Can be less predictable as the state of an object might change depending on when and if the setter methods are called.

Q11. Explain scope of Bean in Spring?
Scope       	Description                            	Lifetime                     	Use Case
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singleton   	Single instance shared across the container	Entire application lifecycle	Stateless shared beans
Prototype   	New instance per request                 	Until no longer referenced  	Stateful or per-use beans
Request     	New instance per HTTP request            	One HTTP request            	Request-scoped web data
Session     	New instance per HTTP session            	One HTTP session            	Session-scoped user data
Application 	Single instance across the ServletContext	Entire web application      	Application-wide configurations

Q12. Difference between @Autowired vs new keyword?
@Autowired provides loose coupling by allowing spring to manage dependencies while new keyword creates tight coupling by directly initiating a class.





(2) Basics of Spring Boot :
-----------------------------
 Q1. What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone applications quickly and easily with minimal configuration.
Spring Boot Stand-Alone Application:
-> You just run a main() method like any regular Java program.
-> It includes an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) in the application itself.
-> No need to install or configure any external server separately.
-> When you run above program:
	a. Starts up the embedded server.
	b. Deploys your app on it.
	c. Listens to HTTP requests (like a web server).
Note: Since Spring boot is stand alone application, we package the application as jar file


Q2. What are the main features of Spring Boot?
- Auto-configuration
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow)
- Starter dependencies
- Spring Boot CLI
- Actuator for monitoring

Q3. What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
Spring and spring boot both are the part of spring framework but they have different purpose as,
SPRING:
•	In spring, developer requires manually configure and manage the dependencies.
•	Need xml configuration
•	No embedded tomcat server
•	It doesn’t have starter tags
SPRING BOOT:
•	In spring boot, it simplify the development of spring boot application by providing defaults and auto-configuration by scanning components.
•	Application. Properties file
•	Embedded tomcat server
•	It has starter dependencies

Q4. What are Spring Boot Starters?
Spring Boot starters are a collection of pre-configured dependencies bundled together to simplify,
project setup. They automatically include all the necessary libraries for a specific functionality:
- spring-boot-starter-web → for REST APIs
- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa → for database + JPA
- spring-boot-starter-security → for authentication/authorization

Q5. How do you create a Spring Boot project?
- Using Spring Initializr (start.spring.io)
- Using Spring Boot CLI
- Using Spring Tool Suite / IntelliJ / Eclipse

Q6. Explain working of Spring Boot?
- Dependencies: You add required starters (like spring-boot-starter-web) in pom.xml or build.gradle.
- Auto-Configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures beans, controllers, database connections, etc., based on those dependencies (so you don’t need much XML or manual config).
- Component Scanning: It scans your project for classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc., and registers them in the Spring container.
- Embedded Server: For web apps, it starts an embedded server (like Tomcat/Jetty) automatically.
- Run as Standalone: You just run the main class with @SpringBootApplication, and the application is ready.

Q7. What are spring-boot-starter-parent?
spring-boot-starter-parent is a special starter provided by Spring Boot that acts as the parent for your project in Maven. 
It simplifies project configuration by providing a set of default settings and versions for dependencies, plugins, and Java compatibility
 WHAT IT DOES:
     - Manages Dependency Versions: Ensures consistent and compatible versions of libraries and frameworks, so you don’t have to specify them manually
     - Default Plugin Configuration: Pre-configures common Maven plugins (like maven-compiler-plugin) for tasks like compiling and packaging.
     - Default Java Version: Sets a default Java version (e.g., 17 or 8, depending on the Spring Boot version).

Q8. What are the key dependencies of Spring Boot?
  - Spring-boot-starter-parent
  - Spring-boot-starter-web
  - Spring-boot-starter-security
  - Spring-boot-starter-actuator
  - Spring-boot-starter-test
  - Spring-boot-starter-plugin

Q9. What are the different modules in Spring?
Module        	Includes
------         ----------
Core          	Context, Beans, Core, SpEL
Web           	Spring Web, Spring MVC, WebFlux
Data Access   	JDBC, ORM (Hibernate, JPA), Transactions
AOP           	Aspect-Oriented Programming (e.g., Logging, Security)
Security      	Authentication, Authorization, OAuth2, JWT
Testing       	Mocking, JUnit/TestNG, Integration Testing

Q10. Explain difference between Spring Boot vs Spring Cloud?
 - Spring Boot is mainly used for building standalone applications easily with minimal configuration. 
   It provides features like embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty), auto-configuration, and starter dependencies to speed up development.
- Spring Cloud, on the other hand, is used when you build cloud-native or microservices-based applications. 
  It adds features like service discovery, load balancing, circuit breakers, API Gateway, and centralized configuration to manage multiple services working together.

Q11. How many requests can a Spring Boot project handle simultaneously?
- Spring Boot project can handle simultaneously request  depends on various factors, including the server configuration, application design, hardware resources 
- If you use the default embedded Tomcat server, it can handle 200 concurrent requests by default because Tomcat’s default maxThreads = 200.
- This number can be increased or decreased by changing the configuration in application.properties (e.g., server.tomcat.threads.max=300).

Q12. Can we override or replace the embedded Tomcat server in Spring Boot?
- By default, Spring Boot uses embedded Tomcat.
- If we want Jetty (or Undertow), we exclude spring-boot-starter-tomcat and add the respective starter (like spring-boot-starter-jetty).
- This is done using <exclusion> (Maven)

Q13. Can we disable the default web server in the Spring Boot application?
yes, spring boot provide a feature to disable the web server in quick configuration. we can use the application.properties file to configure the web application type
ex:- spring.main.web.application.type=none.
Use cases: 
    - Non-web applications : You may want to build a console app, batch process or background service that doesn’t expose REST APIs.
    - Message-driven applications → For example, using Spring Boot with Kafka,where your app listens to messages instead of HTTP requests.
    - Microservices support apps → A helper microservice that only processes data/events and doesn’t need a web endpoint.

Q14. How to disable a specific auto-configuration class?
 You can disable a specific auto-configuration class in Spring Boot using the exclude attribute in @SpringBootApplication annotation.
 eg-
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = { DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class })
public class MyApplication {
}
Note:- This tells Spring Boot not to load that particular auto-configuration.

Q15. What is Web Services?
A web service is a software system designed to support compatible machine-to-machine interaction over a network. 
It can be called from anywhere and accessed using any technology, such as Java, C++, or Python.
The most common methods for sharing data in web services are:
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Web Services:
•	Data Format: XML (Extensible Markup Language)
•	Transmission Protocol: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc.
REST (Representational State Transfer) Web Services:
•	Data Format: Typically JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), but also XML or other formats.
•	Transmission Protocol: HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

Q16. Can we create a RESTful API without using @RestController annotation?
Yes, it is possible to create restful API using combination of @controller and @ResponseBody annotation.

Q17. How can we override default properties in Spring Boot?
We can override default properties by defining our own values in the application.properties (or application.yml) file. Spring Boot will pick these values instead of the defaults.
eg -
server.port=8085
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb





(3) configuration :
-----------------------
Q1. How does Spring Boot handle configuration?
👉 Using application.properties or application.yml.

Q2. What is the difference between application.properties and application.yml?
👉 Both are used for configuration:
- .properties → key-value pair format
- .yml → hierarchical structure, better readability

Q3. How can you change the default port in Spring Boot?
👉 In application.properties: server.port=9090

Q4. Is it possible to change the port of embedded Tomcat server in Spring Boot?
YES, Using server.port=9090 

Q5. What is the use of Profiles in Spring Boot?
In Spring Boot, profiles are used to define different configurations for different environments (like dev, test, prod).
We can keep separate property files such as application-dev.properties, application-qa.properties, application-prod.properties, and activate them using spring.profiles.active.
eg-
application-dev.properties → use H2 database
application-prod.properties → use MySQL/Oracle
Note:- So, profiles help us switch environment-specific settings easily without changing code.




(4) REST & Controllers  :
--------------------------

Q1. How do you create a REST API in Spring Boot?
👉 Use @RestController and map requests with @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.

Q2. Difference between POST vs PUT method?
POST:
•	Used to create a new resource.
•	Multiple POST requests may create multiple resources with different identifiers.
•	Usually returns 201 Created
PUT:
•	Used to update an existing resource or create one if it doesn't exist.
•	Multiple PUT requests with the same data result in the same resource state.
•	Typically returns 200 OK (for update) or 201 Created (if a new resource was created).

Q3. Difference between GET and POST?
GET:
•	Retrieves data from the server.
•	Data is appended to the URL as query parameters.
•	Data is visible in the URL and can be bookmarked.
•	Less secure as data is exposed in the URL.
•	Repeated requests yield the same result.
•	Typically returns 200 OK.
POST:
•	Sends data to the server to create or process resources.
•	Data is included in the request body.
•	Data is hidden and not visible in the URL.
•	More secure as data is sent in the body. However, HTTPS is needed for full security.
•	Repeated requests may result in multiple actions (e.g., duplicate submissions).
•	Typically returns 201 Created for successful creation or 200 OK for successful processing.

Q4. Difference between PUT and PATCH?
PUT:
•	Used to replace the entire resource with a new representation.
PATCH:
•	Used to partially update a resource.

Q5. What is HTTP status code & categories of HTTP codes?
HTTP status code are three digits numbers which help to communicate whether a request was successfully processed, 
resulted in an error, or requires further action. CATEGORIES OF HTTP CODES:
Category	Range    	Description
---------------------------------------------------------------
1xx     	100–199 	Informational: Request received, continuing process.
2xx     	200–299 	Success: Request was successfully processed.
3xx     	300–399 	Redirection: Client must take additional action.
4xx     	400–499 	Client Error: Request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
5xx     	500–599 	Server Error: Server failed to fulfill a valid request.

Q6. How many types of HTTP methods?
> get
> post
> put
> patch
> delete
> option
> trace
> head

Q7. What are HTTP Headers?
HTTP Headers are key-value pairs sent between the client and server in a request or response.
They provide extra information (metadata) like content type, authentication, cookies, and caching instructions.
🔹 Request Headers :
    - Accept → Tells the server what response formats the client can handle (e.g., application/json).
    - Authorization → Sends authentication credentials like tokens or API keys (e.g., Bearer token).
    - Content-Type → Tells the server the format of the request body (e.g., JSON, XML).
    - User-Agent → Identifies the client making the request (browser, Postman, etc.).
    - Host → Specifies the domain name (and port) of the target server.
🔹 Response Headers :
    - Content-Type → Defines the type of data returned (e.g., application/json).
    - Content-Length → Size of the response body in bytes.
    - Set-Cookie → Sends cookies from the server to the client for storage.
    - Cache-Control → Tells how responses should be cached (e.g., no-store, max-age=3600).
    - Access-Control-Allow-Origin → Specifies which domains can access the response (CORS).

Q8. Difference between Query Parameter vs Path Parameter?
| Aspect          | Query Parameter                                        | Path Parameter                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**  | Extra information sent in the URL, usually optional.   | Part of the URL that identifies a specific item.  |
| **Position**    | After `?` in the URL, multiple separated by `&`.       | Inside the URL path itself, usually in `{}`.      |
| **Syntax**      | `?key=value&key2=value2`                               | `/resource/{id}` or `/resource/value`             |
| **Example**     | `https://example.com/products?category=books&sort=asc` | `https://example.com/products/12345`              |
| **When to Use** | For optional info like filters, search terms.          | For mandatory info like IDs of a product or user. |





(5) JPA & Database  :
-----------------------

Q1. How do you connect Spring Boot to a database?
👉 Add spring-boot-starter-data-jpa + DB driver dependency, configure datasource in application.properties.

Q2. What is the role of Repository in spring boot?
👉 Provides CRUD methods like save(), findAll(), findById(), etc. 

Q3. What is the difference between CrudRepository and JpaRepository?
- CrudRepository → Basic CRUD methods, findAll() Returns Iterable 
- JpaRepository → Extends CrudRepository, adds JPA-specific features (pagination, sorting), findAll() returns list 

Q4. How do you define a custom query in Spring Boot JPA?
👉 Using @Query

Q5. How JpaRepository object is created in Spring Boot even if it is an interface?
👉 JPA interface object automatically created and managed by Spring. This happens because of Spring Data JPA's dynamic proxy mechanism,
custom interface extend JpaRepository (or CrudRepository), Spring automatically detects it during the application startup. 
Once the proxy object is created, it is managed by the Spring container.

Q6. How do you implement pagination in Spring Boot JPA?
👉 Using Pageable:





(6) Monitoring & Management :
-------------------------------

Q1. What is Spring Boot Actuator?
👉 A tool that provides production-ready features like monitoring, health checks, metrics, and auditing.

Q2. What are the key endpoints provided by Spring Boot Actuator?
ACTUATOR ENDPOINT:
-> by default endpoints can be seen at : http://localhost:8080/actuator/
-> expose all endpoints use this in properties file : management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
-> to expose only selected endpoints : management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=health,info,env,beans
-> to get enviromental configuration about server : http://localhost:8080/actuator/env
-> to get all spring beans loaded in the context : http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans
-> Provides metrics about memory, CPU, garbage collection, etc :   /metrics
-> Shows and configures logging levels at runtime: /loggers 

Q3. HOW WILL YOU CUSTOMIZE THE MANAGEMENT SERVER PORT FOR ACTUATOR?
👉 MANAGEMENT.SERVER.PORT=9090

Q4. How do you change the default /actuator base path for Spring Boot Actuator endpoints?
👉 MANAGEMENT.ENDPOINTS.WEB.BASE-PATH=/INSTEAD OF ACTUATOR USE ANYTHING
EX-/MANAGE/HEALTH

Q5. How do you enable/disable specific Actuator endpoints in Spring Boot?
You can manage Actuator endpoints using properties: management.endpoint.health.enabled=true

Q6. How do you secure Actuator endpoints in Spring Boot?
Using Spring Security (Recommended): Configure access rules in SecurityFilterChain

Q7. How will you expose your custom endpoints in Spring Actuator?
This can be achieved by the adding following anotations:
@Endpoint and @Component to class and
@ReadOperation, @WriteOperation or @DeleteOperation on method level

@ReadOperation maps to httpGet
@WriteOperation maps to httpPost
@DeleteOperation maps to httpDelete
Note : by adding @Bean annotated with @Endpoint , any methods annotated with @ReadOperation , @WriteOperation or @DeleteOperation are
       automatically exposed over JMX or http.
eg-
@Component
@Endpoint(id="customActuator")
public class customActuator{

@ReadOperation
public String returnString(){
return "hello";
}
}

Q8. What is HTTP Trace in Spring Boot?
HTTP Trace is a Spring Boot Actuator feature that provides detailed information about the recent HTTP requests received by the application. 
It helps in debugging and monitoring by showing request and response details, including headers, status codes, and execution times.
The trace includes information like:
•	HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
•	URL and headers
•	Response status code
•	Request and response time
•	Remote IP address
How HTTP Trace Works:
When enabled, Spring Boot captures the last N HTTP requests (default: 100).
HOW TO Enabling HTTP Trace in Spring Boot?
For Spring Boot 3.x:
STEP 1=>  Enable httpexchanges in application.properties: 
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=httpexchanges
STEP 2: Add the required bean
@Bean
public HttpExchangeRepository httpExchangeRepository() {
    return new InMemoryHttpExchangeRepository();
}
STEP 3: HIT THE URL (GET) 
http://localhost:8080/actuator/httpexchanges



Q9. How can Actuator integrate with tools like Prometheus and Grafana?




(7) Security  :
-----------------

Q1. How do you secure a Spring Boot application?
👉 Add spring-boot-starter-security. By default, it enables basic authentication with a generated password.

Q2. What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
👉
- AUTHENTICATION: authentication is the process of validating your credential ( such as username and password) to verify your identity whether 
                you are the person who is claiming or not. / Who are you? (login, password check)
- AUTHERIZATION: authorization is the process to determine whether you have right to access what you want or not. / What can you do? (access control, roles)

Q3. How do you configure custom user details in Spring Security?
👉 Implement UserDetailsService and override loadUserByUsername().

Q4. What is the role of UserDetailsService in Spring Security?
UserDetailsService is a core interface in Spring Security used to fetch user-related data, It has a single method loadUserByUsername(String username) and Its job is to:
Retrieve user information (username, password, roles/authorities) from a database or any custom source.Return a UserDetails object, which Spring Security uses for authentication and authorization.

Q5. How do you store passwords securely in a Spring Boot app?
In Spring Boot, we store passwords using PasswordEncoder, which applies a one-way hashing algorithm (so the original password can’t be retrieved).
It also uses a salt — a random string added before hashing — to make each password hash unique and more secure.

Q6. What is a SecurityFilterChain and how do you configure it in Spring Boot?
SecurityFilterChain is an interface in Spring Security that defines the security filters (authentication, authorization, CSRF, CORS, etc.) applied to HTTP requests.
we configure security by creating a @Bean method that takes HttpSecurity, sets up the rules, and then calls .build() to return a SecurityFilterChain.

Q7. How do you secure REST APIs in Spring Boot?
Secure APIs with Spring Security, typically using JWT for stateless auth + role-based access.

Q8. How can you restrict access to specific endpoints in Spring Boot?
- Using SecurityFilterChain :  .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
- Using Annotations @PreAuthorize or @Secured at method level : @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")

Q9. Explain Spring Security internal flow?
Client Request
       |
       v
Security Filter Chain (FilterChainProxy)
       |
       v
Authentication Filter (e.g., UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter)
       |
       v
AuthenticationManager
       |
       v
AuthenticationProvider(s) ---> UserDetailsService ---> User Store (DB/In-memory)
       |
       v
Authentication Object (with roles/authorities)
       |
       v
SecurityContextHolder (stores Authentication)
       |
       v
Authorization Filters / AccessDecisionManager
       |
       v
Controller (if access granted)
       |
       v
Response
       |
       v
SecurityContextHolder Cleared (end of request)
Note:- ONE LINER ANSWER 
  - Client Request → The user/browser sends a request to the application.
  - Security Filter Chain → Intercepts the request and applies security checks using multiple filters.
  - Authentication Filter → Extracts credentials (username/password, token) from the request.
  - AuthenticationManager → Delegates authentication to the appropriate provider.
  - AuthenticationProvider → Verifies credentials against the user store (DB, in-memory, etc.).
  - UserDetailsService → Loads user details like username, password, and roles from the database.
  - Authentication Object → Holds the authenticated user’s details and granted authorities.
  - SecurityContextHolder → Stores the Authentication object for the current request/session.
  - Authorization Filters / AccessDecisionManager → Checks if the user has permission to access the requested resource.
  - Controller → Handles the request if access is granted.
  - Response → Sends back the HTTP response to the client.
  - SecurityContextHolder Cleared → Cleans up the security context at the end of the request to avoid data leaks.






(8) JWT  :
----------------

Q1. What is JWT?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a way of doing token-based authentication. After a user logs in, the server gives a digitally signed token (JWT) instead of keeping a session. 
The client then sends this token with each request, and the server checks it to confirm the user’s identity without storing session data.

Q2. What are the parts of a JWT?
-> Header – metadata, e.g., type (JWT) and algorithm (HS256).
-> Payload – contains claims (user info, roles, expiration).
-> Signature – like a stamp/sign that proves the token is real and not changed. contains : A hashed value created using (Header + Payload + Secret Key), check token was changed or not

Q3. What is the difference between JWT and session-based authentication?
Session-based : 
- Server stores session data, client keeps session ID in cookie.
- On each request, server checks session from its memory/database.
- it is Stateful.
JWT : 
- Server gives a token (JWT) to client.
- Client stores token in localStorage / cookie and sends it with each request.
- it is Stateless

Q4. What are claims in JWT?
Claims are pieces of information in the payload.
Types:
-> Registered claims – iss (issuer), exp (expiry), sub (subject), etc.
-> Public claims – custom claims like roles, email.
-> Private claims – shared between parties, e.g., userId.

Q5. How does JWT work in a Spring Boot application?
- User logs in with username/password.
- Server validates credentials.
- Server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
- Client includes JWT in Authorization header for subsequent requests.
- Server validates the token, extracts user info, and allows access.

Q6. How do you generate a JWT in Java?
- Start by creating a JWT builder.
- Set the subject (e.g., username).
- Add extra claims (like roles, email, etc.).
- Define issued time and expiration time.
- Sign the token using a secret key and algorithm (e.g., HS256).
- Finally, generate (compact) the JWT string.

Q7. How do you validate a JWT?
- Use the same secret key that was used to sign it.
- Parse the token and check: Signature is valid , Token is not expired , Claims are correct

Q8. Where do you store JWT on the client side?
HTTP-only cookie (for better security against XSS)

Q9. How do you send JWT in API requests?
Include in HTTP header: Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

Q10. How do you secure REST APIs using JWT in Spring Boot?
- Create a JWT filter extending OncePerRequestFilter.
- Intercept requests, extract token from header, validate it, set authentication in SecurityContext.
- Configure SecurityFilterChain to use the JWT filter before UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.

Q11. What is the difference between access token and refresh token?
Access Token:
- A short-lived token (e.g., 15 mins – 1 hour).
- Sent with each API request to prove the user is logged in.
- If stolen, it’s valid only for a short time.
Refresh Token:
- A long-lived token (e.g., days or weeks).
- Not sent with every request, only used to get a new access token when it expires.
- Helps the user stay logged in without entering credentials again.

Q12. How do you include user roles in JWT and check them in Spring Security?
- Add roles as a claim: .claim("roles", List.of("USER","ADMIN"))
- During token validation, convert claims to GrantedAuthority and set in UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken for role-based access.

Q13. How do you handle token expiration?
- Add an exp claim inside the JWT to set expiry time.
- When a request comes, server checks if token is expired.
- If expired → reject request and return 401 Unauthorized.
- If refresh token is used → generate a new access token without asking user to log in again.

Q14. What libraries are commonly used for JWT in Java/Spring Boot?
-> Spring Security – for authentication and authorization framework.
-> jjwt-api – main JWT interfaces and classes.
-> jjwt-impl – implementation of the JJWT API.
-> jjwt-jackson – for JSON processing inside JWT (requires Jackson).

Q15. How do you refresh JWT tokens?
- Client sends refresh token to /refresh endpoint.
- Server validates refresh token.
- Issue a new access token with updated expiry.

Q16. How do you implement JWT filter in Spring Boot?
- Extend OncePerRequestFilter.
- Override doFilterInternal:
- Extract token from Authorization header.
- Validate token.
- Set Authentication in SecurityContext.
- Register filter before UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.

Q17. How do you test JWT-secured APIs?
- Use Postman/Insomnia:
- Login → get JWT.
- Set Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
- Access secured endpoints.
